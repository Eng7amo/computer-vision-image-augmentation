# Wildlife Image Augmentation Pipeline for Object Detection

## Overview
This repository presents an image processing and data augmentation pipeline designed to support object detection tasks in wildlife monitoring scenarios.

The project is derived from a hands-on DataCamp exercise and focuses on preparing visual data for machine learning models by increasing dataset diversity through systematic image transformations.

## Business Context
Wildlife documentaries rely on thousands of hours of recorded footage. Manually reviewing this footage to identify animal appearances is time-consuming and inefficient.

By preparing augmented image datasets, object detection models can be trained to:
- Automatically detect animals in video footage
- Reduce manual inspection effort
- Accelerate documentary production workflows

---

## Project Objectives
- Build a reusable image processing pipeline
- Apply resizing, rotation, and contrast enhancement
- Generate augmented datasets from limited samples
- Prepare data suitable for object detection model training

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image

---

## Repository Structure


---

## Key Outcomes
- Modular image processing function
- Augmented image samples for model training
- Visualization of transformation effects
- Reproducible preprocessing workflow

---

## Certification
This project is part of a verified DataCamp learning experience.  
Certificate and verification details are available in the `docs/` directory.
